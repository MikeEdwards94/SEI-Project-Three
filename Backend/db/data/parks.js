Large numbers of Lions, Cheetah, Elephant, Rhino, African Buffalo, Wildebeest, Giraffe, Zebra and many more animals are found here in their natural habitat, unconfined and free to roam the vast wilderness stretching for miles on end. It is no surprise then that tourists from the world over travel here not least because the reserve has been voted one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. Regarding the origin of the name, the word \'Masai\' comes from the Maasai tribe, nomadic inhabitants of the area and the word \'Mara\' is their word for \'spotted\', referring to the ubiquitous unique flat topped acacia trees, shrubs and bushes that dot the landscape across most of the reserve.' ,

      'It is named in honor of the Maasai people (the ancestral inhabitants of the area) and their description of the area when looked at from afar: "Mara" means "spotted" in the local Maasai language of Maa, due to the many trees which dot the landscape.',
      'The Mara is home to the big five as well as the Big Nine African animals (lion, leopard, elephant, cape buffalo, and rhinoceros) along with more than 400 bird species identified in the park, many of which are migranting species and with almost 60 species being raptors.',
      'Great Wildebeest migration has been selected as one of the seven natural wonders of the World and takes place every year between late July to end of September, though this timing can vary somewhat due to prevailing rainfall patterns.',

    description: 'The Etosha Pan is a vast, bare, open expanse of shimmering green and white that covers around 4,800km², almost a quarter of the beautiful Etosha National Park. At 130 km’s long and up to 50km’s wide in places, it is comfortably the largest salt pan in Africa and is the park’s most distinctive and dramatic feature, visible even from space. The pan was originally a lake but over time the earth’s climate forced the rivers that once fed the lake to change course and flow into the Atlantic Ocean. If one were to try find where the lake once lay today, only the dry baked alkaline clay marks would give you a clue. In the language of the Ovambo tribe, Etosha means ‘great white place’, a name passed on to the first Europeans to come across this “immense hollow”, Sir Francis Galton and Charles Andersson in 1851, with the help of travelling Ovambo traders. The area was originally inhabited by the Heli/ om- people who were well known hunter gatherers and co- existed in harmony with huge herds of wildlife in the area. It was only in 1851 when the huge pan first became known to Europeans. Explorers Charles Andersson and Francis Galton reached a cattle post called Omutjamatunda which is today called Namutoni. The two explorers provided the first written account of the pan. It is believed that this natural mineral pan was first formed over 100 million years ago. About 16,000 years ago, the Kunene River in Angola would have flowed all the way to Etosha, forming, for some time, a huge and deep lake. But the river would later change its course due to tectonic plate movement and head for the Atlantic, causing the lake to slowly dry up and leaving the salt pan behind.',

Together the four parks make up Redwood National and State Parks, which was established in 1994 to help combine efforts to save the redwood forests. 96% of old redwood growth has been logged.',
