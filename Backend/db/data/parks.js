    description: 'Masai Mara National Reserve located in south west Kenya is a vast scenic expanse of gently rolling African savannah plains measuring 1510 square kilometers in area and bordering the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the south. Masai Mara is a unique wildlife conservation haven, famous for its spectacular natural diversity of wildlife and happens to be a premier Kenya Safari location in East Africa, offering visitors many reasons to visit this animal paradise. Large numbers of Lions, Cheetah, Elephant, Rhino, African Buffalo, Wildebeest, Giraffe, Zebra and many more animals are found here in their natural habitat, unconfined and free to roam the vast wilderness stretching for miles on end. It is no surprise then that tourists from the world over travel here not least because the reserve has been voted one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. Regarding the origin of the name, the word \'Masai\' comes from the Maasai tribe, nomadic inhabitants of the area and the word \'Mara\' is their word for \'spotted\', referring to the ubiquitous unique flat topped acacia trees, shrubs and bushes that dot the landscape across most of the reserve.' ,

    facts: [ 'Maasai Mara National Reserve is one of the largest game reserves in Kenya, widely considered to be Africa’s greatest wildlife reserve (also known as Masai Mara and by the locals as The Mara). ',
      'Maasai Mara National Reserve stretches 1,510 square kilometers (580 square miles) and raises 1,500-2,170 meters (4920-7120 feet) above sea level.',
      'The Mara Game Reserve is known all over the world for a wide range of wild animals such as the " big five " (lion, leopard, African elephant, cape buffalo, and black rhinoceros) and other popular species like zebra, giraffe, hyena, cheetah, wildebeest, eland and Thomson\'s gazelle.',
      'It is named in honor of the Maasai people (the ancestral inhabitants of the area) and their description of the area when looked at from afar: "Mara" means "spotted" in the local Maasai language of Maa, due to the many trees which dot the landscape.',
      'The Mara is home to the big five as well as the Big Nine African animals (lion, leopard, elephant, cape buffalo, and rhinoceros) along with more than 400 bird species identified in the park, many of which are migranting species and with almost 60 species being raptors.',
      'Great Wildebeest migration has been selected as one of the seven natural wonders of the World and takes place every year between late July to end of September, though this timing can vary somewhat due to prevailing rainfall patterns.',
      'There are currently estimated to be between 800 to 900 Lions ( including Lionesses) in the greater Masai Mara area, to include the conservancies surrounding the core reserve.',
      'Arguably the single most iconic tribe in Africa, the Maasai are nomadic pastrolists who traditionally make a living out of herding cattle. Originally a Nilotic ethnic group which is said to have migrated centuries ago from the semi arid Nile valley north of Lake Turkana, the Maasai inhabit the region around Masai Mara as well as large portions of Great Rift Valley.'

Virunga is the continent’s most biologically diverse protected area and a national park embarking on an ambitious development programme known as the “Virunga Alliance”. Situated in a region which has been deeply impacted by the effects of war and armed conflict for over 20 years, Virunga is currently protected by a dedicated team of 689 Rangers. These local men and women go through intensive training, risking their lives on a daily basis to safeguard the Park’s exceptional wildlife, including the last of the world’s endangered mountain gorillas. Alongside this essential conservation work, the Park is committed to supporting local communities. Virunga has a vision for responsibly harnessing the Park’s natural resources to create new opportunities for the four million people that live within a day’s walk of its borders.',

      'The Park’s 3,000 square miles (7,800 square kilometers) is comprised of four sectors – northern, central,  southern and lake sector – each with an unrivaled diversity of landscapes and ecosystems.',
      'Virunga National Park was founded in 1925 as Albert National Park. It was the first national park to be established on the continent of Africa, primarily to protect the mountain gorillas living in the forests of the Virunga Massif.',
      'The world’s entire population of critically endangered mountain gorillas live only in the Virunga Massif and Bwindi National Park, which spans parts of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Rwanda. Virunga National Park is home to around a third of those gorillas, which reside in the dense forests on the lush slopes of the Virunga volcanoes.',
      'The world population of mountain gorillas is currently estimated to be at around 1000 individuals. In Virunga’s southern sector around Bukima, there are currently ten habituated gorilla families and four solitary males which are also habituated, meaning that they are unafraid of human presence.',
      '2000 rangers have lost their lives in the line of duty since 1925',

    description: 'The Etosha Pan is a vast, bare, open expanse of shimmering green and white that covers around 4,800km², almost a quarter of the beautiful Etosha National Park. At 130 km’s long and up to 50km’s wide in places, it is comfortably the largest salt pan in Africa and is the park’s most distinctive and dramatic feature, visible even from space. The pan was originally a lake but over time the earth’s climate forced the rivers that once fed the lake to change course and flow into the Atlantic Ocean. If one were to try find where the lake once lay today, only the dry baked alkaline clay marks would give you a clue. In the language of the Ovambo tribe, Etosha means ‘great white place’, a name passed on to the first Europeans to come across this “immense hollow”, Sir Francis Galton and Charles Andersson in 1851, with the help of travelling Ovambo traders. The area was originally inhabited by the Heli/ om- people who were well known hunter gatherers and co- existed in harmony with huge herds of wildlife in the area. It was only in 1851 when the huge pan first became known to Europeans. Explorers Charles Andersson and Francis Galton reached a cattle post called Omutjamatunda which is today called Namutoni. The two explorers provided the first written account of the pan. It is believed that this natural mineral pan was first formed over 100 million years ago. About 16,000 years ago, the Kunene River in Angola would have flowed all the way to Etosha, forming, for some time, a huge and deep lake. But the river would later change its course due to tectonic plate movement and head for the Atlantic, causing the lake to slowly dry up and leaving the salt pan behind.',

      'It is the only known mass breeding ground for flamingos in Namibia. At times there can be around 1 million flamingos in the pan',
      'For only a few days each year when it rains enough to create a lagoon in the normally dry Etosha Pan, a large number of pelicans and flamingoes can be seen in the water.',
      'At the southern border of Etosha National Park lie the dolomite hills. These are called Ondundozonananandana. This means \'place where young boy herding cattle went to never return\'. This likely indicates a lot of predatory animals in the region. Leopard Hills is the name of the mountains.',
      'Most of the park\'s pans have no vegetation growing while the majority of the park\'s landscape is otherwise savanna woodlands. With only 23% of the park made up of salt pans, the majority of it does have plenty of vegetation to support wildlife.',
      'There is a very large and diverse bird population in Etosha National Park and species include vultures, storks, hornbills, waterfowl, falcons, bustards, herons, owls, and many more.'

In fact, those in charge intend to eradicate 40,000 of the 65,000 Maasai people living on this land to make it more suitable for luxury hotels that cater predominantly to foreign tourists.

There are around 30,000 animals ranging from leopard, cheetah, elephant and hyena to warthog, buffalo and impala. It’s also one of the best places to see the endangered black rhino and black-maned male lions.',
      'You won’t find any giraffes in the crater. It’s thought they can’t enter as the sides are too steep for them to walk down. However you’ll still be able to find them around the crater. ',
