<h1>Project 3 - The Natural Wanderer</h1>

<h3>Project Overview:</h3>

For the third project at GA we were tasked with building a full stack MERN application in a group of three over the period of one week.


<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

* React.js
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB/ Mongoose
* Axios
* React Mapbox GL
* SASS
* Semantic UI Framework
* Nodemon
* Bcrypt
* Body-parser
* JWT
* Git/ GitHub

__APIs Used__

* Mapbox
* Weather API

<h3>Planning Phase</h3>

After some brain-storming we quickly settled on a global National Park application, where users would be able to look up parks, get information and add it to a wishlist of sorts. First  we drew up a user flow chart using Miro, so we could all get a good grip on what pages were going to be required but also to structure a way for the user to easily navigate around the app.

We then went onto build a basic wireframe for the design of some of the pages. Although none of us had a clear direction of colours, layout etc. at this stage, we wanted to have a base upon which to build on, so we could have some level of consistency from the start as we would end up working on different components. At this was the first full stack MERN app we had all undertaken we made a conscious effort to keep the scope of the project small, even though we had a lot of ideas for post-MVP, so we could have a solid end-product that we could keep building upon if we had the time.

From here we made a list of everything we thought each component would consist of and added them all down onto a google sheet. From here we could then derive what schemas we would require and what they would consist of.

The last phase of our planning was to list any tasks on a Trello Board. This helped not only remind us of any outstanding issues, but organise who was doing what task, particularly over the weekend or when people were working at different times of day.

<h3>Backend</h3>



<h3>Frontend</h3>


<h3>Division of Work</h3>

At the start of the day we would discuss what areas we needed completing next and from there would decide who would do what. All three of us were very easy-going as to what area we would like to work on, therefore we all got involved with both the front-end and back-end, but each built out different components. 

<h3>Styling</h3>

For this project we decided to use a framework none of us had used before in Semantic UI. This proved to be a bit more tricky than Bulma which we had all used before, but we all wanted to challenge ourselves to a new framework. Overall the design came out well, as we aimed to have a fairly clean and clear look to the website, which would be easy to navigate. It is also responsive, which was one of the early considerations that led us to using a framework as we were conscious of the timeframe to complete this project.


<h3>Challenges</h3>

One of the biggest challenges I experienced on this project was the addition of the mapbox with line plotting features. This was a later post-MVP addition that both Jonty and I worked on, which proved to be awkward to implement, however we did manage to get there by the end!

<h3>Wins</h3>

* Reached MVP with much faster than we thought we might, this allowed us to expand on some of our ideas and add more polish to the end product.
We worked very well as a group, all ideas and problems with code were discussed and worked on as a group meaning we were able to problem-solve a lot quicker and be consistent with the style of our end product.

* The app works, from finding the parks, to the adding of recommendations, to leaving comments.

<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>

* A search/ filter for the user to find a specific park
* Perhaps expand on mapbox - add in directions to destinations or mark locations of recommendations
* A spinner UI so users know if something is loading or not
* Choose park rating by clicking on stars opposed to typing in number

<h3>Key Learnings</h3>

**Organisation** - I felt like we did a fair amount of pre-code planning for this project which with hindsight helped enormously. Throughout the project we would be in a zoom call (sometimes with camera/ mic turned off) meaning if we needed to discuss anything we could just shout. This meant we were all on the same wavelength and had really good group harmony towards our end-goal.

**Backend** - This was the first big project with a backend that I did, initially this was a slightly daunting task, but after reading over some documentation and methodically working through the code, it really solidified my understanding of it.

**Clean Code** - Initially we kept the code quite clean, however towards the end of the project some of the components grew quite large. At that point in time, we as a three all understood the inner workings, but after taking a step back I can see there are parts which could’ve been cleaned up or split up, so it's easier to read. I think had we had a bit more time, we could’ve definitely achieved this, but the timeframe in which to build was quite limited!
